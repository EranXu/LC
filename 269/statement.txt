here is a new alien language which uses the latin alphabet. However, the order among letters are unknown to you. You receive a list of non-empty words from the dictionary, where words are sorted lexicographically by the rules of this new language. Derive the order of letters in this language.

Example 1:

Input:
[
  "wrt",
  "wrf",
  "er",
  "ett",
  "rftt"
]

Output: 
"wertf"

Example 2:

Input:
[
  "z",
  "x"
]

Output: 
"zx"

Example 3:

Input:
[
  "z",
  "x",
  "z"
] 

Output: 
""
 

Explanation: The order is invalid, so return 
""

也就说，根据顺序表推导出所有顺序，如果出现环就返回空
例如
abc
cd
推导出abcd
